  title: 'MY WORK'
  portfolio_list:
    - name: Ejector Unit
      image: 'images/portfolio/ejector_unit.jpg'
      description: Designed an ejector for pneumatic conveying of micron-sized powders. Optimized suction chamber and nozzle geometry for particle size, density, and shape, ensuring stable entrainment with minimal agglomeration. CAD-modeled and dimensioned for fabrication, with focus on efficiency, low pressure drop, and reliability.

    - name: Dispenser Body
      image: 'images/portfolio/dispenser_body.jpg'
      description: Designed a pressure vessel for a dispensing unit, used to store and inject powder material at high pressure in process industries. The vessel geometry and reinforcement were developed to ensure strength, safe pressurization, and reliable discharge of fine powders. Suitable for pneumatic conveying and injection systems where precise dosing and consistent flow are required. Modeled and detailed in CAD for fabrication, with focus on structural integrity and operational safety.

    - name: Dispensing Unit on Structural Platform
      image: 'images/portfolio/dispenser_unit.jpg'
      description: This unit is designed for high-pressure dispensing of powdered material. It is mounted on a structural frame and consists of a charging hopper, an intermediate pressurized chamber, a dispenser vessel, a fluidizing chamber, and an ejector. The system conveys material through a pipeline using compressed air, ensuring controlled, efficient, and reliable transfer of powders in process applications where material is to be injected at considerably high pressure.
